# Aperioth
---

Aperioth is a giant library with a book for everything which does, can, has, or will exist. No one knows who put them there in the first place or who takes care of it, but it's a common belief that there is an entity within the library which maintains it.

While in the library you will notice time move slower. Time moves at 1/60th it's normal speed here, making it perfect to study.

Aperioth's links are [[outer realms/Boria|Boria]] and [[outer realms/Elysia|Elysia]].
