# Midnight

---

Midnight ~~is~~ ``was`` a huge city which ~~towers~~ ``towered`` into the stars.  Midnight has no natural light ``As all places should...``, so lanterns ~~hang~~ ``hung`` from every corner and candles ~~light~~ ``lit`` every window. Midnight ~~is~~ ``was`` the main hub for trade across the realms and ~~acts~~ ``acted`` as a refuge for all who need it. Over 1,000,000 people ~~live~~ ``lived`` here from all across the realms, ~~and dozens pass through every day~~. ``They all belong to us now.``

~~Midnight's links are [[outer realms/Aperioth|Aperioth]] and [[outer realms/Boria|Boria]].~~ ``Midnight has no links. You can not escape.``
