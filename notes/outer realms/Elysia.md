# Elysia

---

Elysia is the elemental realm of air. Floating islands are common and all the creatures there can fly. The primary inhabitants are celestials who have built elaborate cities in the sky. Elysia is considered the realm of law and order, but many chose to ignore it.

Elysia's links are [[outer realms/Virkiri'ith|Virkiri'ith]] and [[outer realms/Ember|Ember]].
