# Virkiri'ith
---

Virkir'ith is the realm of caverns and cliffs. When traveling here one will most likely find themselves in enormous and expansive caves. The underground network on Virkir'ith goes on for kilometres and no one is sure how far down it stretches. It's deepest city lies at 2200 meters below the surface. The surface of Virkiri'ith is a cold, and rocky mountain range. It's always foggy and only short grasses grow here.

Virkiri'ith's links are [[outer realms/Ember|Ember]] and [[outer realms/Daybreak|Daybreak]].
