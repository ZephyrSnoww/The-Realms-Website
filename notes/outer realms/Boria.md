# Boria
---

Boria is a realm which is completely frozen over. Snow storms are frequent and the temperature rarely rises above 40 below. Despite this, many live here, including coniferous trees and the fey. When the storms do stop, the sky is clear as crystal and huge auroras can been seen during the long nights.

Boria's links are [[outer realms/Elysia|Elysia]] and [[outer realms/Virkiri'ith|Virkiri'ith]].
