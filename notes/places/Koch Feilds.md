# Koch Fields
---

The Koch Fields are a massive ice flat in the [[countries/Kaldenvar|Kaldenvar]] interior. They are unique in the fact that the ice forms giant hexagonal or snowflake-like steps, sometimes kilometres wide. Stranger still, the ice is a nice blue color and slightly translucent, unlike regular glacial ice. The exact reason for the formations is unclear as no physical or magical explanation has yet been found. Some claim it to be the fey's doing, and many stories exist of strange encounters in the Koch Fields.
