# Timberfall
---

Timber fall is the largest coniferous forest in the world. Some of the trees here are several thousand years old and well over 300 meters tall. For a long time this forest has been the source of logging, but a few decades ago, [[people/npcs/Acer Frost|Queen Frost]] began a conservation program to keep this forest, any many other natural landmarks, intact. Nowadays, logging is heavily regulated.
