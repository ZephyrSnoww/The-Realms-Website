# Wolfden

Wolfden is the most populous city in [[countries/Kaldenvar|Kaldenvar]] with around 32,000 people. It lies on the coast, west of [[cities/Stormkeep|Stormkeep]], and to its south is [[places/Timberfall|Timberfall]], a massive alpine forest.

Wolfden was once a military stronghold built on a stony outcropping, but has been converted into a bustling city.

Outside the stronghold is where most of the city is. The docks and almost all of the houses and schools are here. All of the buildings outside the stronghold are required to be built on stilts to avoid melting the permafrost and collapsing.

The stronghold itself, colloquially known as "The Den," has been converted into a town square. Most of the shops, smiths, and higher end inns are here, as well as some richer family housing. The roofs of the buildings inside the Den have been joined together, creating an insulated, warm interior and making it ideal for trade and festivals. It's unknown why this was done, but it makes a nice place to stay when the temperature is too cold,[^1] so the residents are happy to clean off the snow when it piles up.

Wolfden's primary export is fish and they are well known for their salmon.

[^1]: It should be noted that "too cold" for a kalvarian is significantly colder than what most of us would consider "too cold."
