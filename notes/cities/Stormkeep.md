# Stormkeep

---

Stormkeep is a stronghold built into a cliff face overlooking the [[places/Stormkeep Bay|Stormkeep Bay]]. It has tall, flat walls spanning the height of the cliffs and at its top sits a town of about 12,000 people. It stands over 120 meters tall, making it the tallest structure ever built.

A dock is located at the base of the wall and the only way to access it is to take a 1 meter wide staircase along the exterior of the stronghold. A pully system also exists to make transporting supplies up and down the wall significantly easer. Stormkeep's main gate, however, is at ground level[^1] and people are free to come and go as they wish.

Stormkeep was built as a defensive fortress which the royalty could stay in and has stood for over 1000 years. The current and long standing queen, [[people/npcs/Acer Frost|Queen Frost]], lives in a cabin overlooking the stronghold.

Rumors say that below the city, inside Stormkeep's thick walls, exists an expansive labyrinth of catacombs and dungeons. No one has ever found any evidence of underground tunnels and Queen Frost claims they don't exist.

[^1]: Because of the geography of Stormkeep Bay, ground level is 130 meters above sea level.
