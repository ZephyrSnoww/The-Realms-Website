# The Realms

## List of Realms

Historically, traveling the realms was common, however this has been lost to time and shadow.

Due to the nature of the realm, one may only travel counter clockwise through the circle planes. This was believed to be due to how the sun moves.

- [[outer realms/Midnight|Midnight]], the city of shadows
- [[outer realms/Aperioth|Aperioth]], the infinite library
- [[outer realms/Ember|Ember]], the fire plane
- [[outer realms/Boria|Boria]], the ice plane (& feywild) "The Frostwild"
- [[outer realms/Acidfall|Acidfall]], the caustic plane
- [[outer realms/Aquaria|Aquaria]], the water plane
- [[outer realms/Elysia|Elysia]], the sky plane
