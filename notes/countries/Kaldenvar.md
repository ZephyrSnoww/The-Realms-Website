# Kaldenvar
---

Kaldenvar is the southern-most country and by far the coldest, being perpetually snowy year-round. Kaldenvar is the second largest by area, but has the smallest population. Its largest city, [[cities/Wolfden|Wolfden]], has only about 32,000 people.

The country is mostly uninhabited wilderness with vast alpine forests and massive sweeping tundras. Like most of the world, the geography is very mountainous, however Kaldenvar's interior has many expansive continental glaciers and ice fields, the most well-known of which are the [[places/Koch Feilds|Koch Feilds]].

(See [Glaciers I: Glacial Landsystems & Locations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPPyDhQ5WHQ) if you want to know more about this kind of topology.)

Kaldenvar has been ruled by a long standing family of wolfkin royalty. The current ruler is [[people/npcs/Acer Frost|Queen Frost]], who has been in power for 98 years. She currently lives in the second largest city, [[cities/Stormkeep|Stormkeep]].
