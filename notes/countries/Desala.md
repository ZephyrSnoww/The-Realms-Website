# Desala
---

Desala is the northernmost and hottest country by far. Most of the country is dry, with rolling dunes and rocky outcroppings. The capital city of Desala is [[cities/Duna|Duna]], a trade city nestled in an oasis valley. Desala is a theocratic monarchey and are very particular about their beliefs in the gods. The current monarch is [[Uu'wun]], a matte black tabaxi.

Desala is known for marauders who scout the open deserts on metal [[things/sand skimmers|sand skimmers]] and ships. They scavenge for parts to build machines with, opting to either look through the sand or steal from unfortunate travlers. Some believe that Desala was the crash site for an ancient ship, which would explain the metal wich can be found in the dunes.
