# Session 2

## Meeting Cognizance
- We all met up in the town square
- We decide to take a short rest
- [[people/pcs/Cognizance|Cognizance]] walks up to us (was following from a distance)
	- We all intro ourselves and whatever
- [[people/pcs/Marie Santello|Marie]] heads into a bakery and gets a donut

## Following the t-rex trail
- We follow the trail of destruction to the cave
	- The scratches don't look like they're from the t-rex
	- There are lots of footprints, the freshest of which are a t-rex running out
- We head in, lots of scratch marks deep in the rock
	- Not like claws, it's not regular enough
- The ground gets wet & muddy
- After a little while the cave opens up quite a bit
	- We can hear flowing water somewhere
	- The ground is relatively smooth on one half of the cave
		- Water on the other side
	- Its pitch black

## Meeting the tetrathoptera
- Past the sound of water, we can hear something stirring relatively far away
- [[people/pcs/Alixxon|Alixxon]] makes a minor illusion of the three shortest in the party
- [[people/pcs/Cognizance|Cognizance]] uses thaumaturgy to make a sound
- It recognizes the illusion
- Combat baby!
	- It starts approaching us :0
	- It has four red eyes and a red crown of thorns
	- Combat happens
- We pull the crown of thorns off of it
- Using talk with animals, [[people/pcs/Holly|Holly]] learns that [[people/npcs/Crisius Fowl|Crisius]] is the one that enchanted it

## Getting the biologist
- [[people/pcs/Holly|Holly]] stays with it while the rest of the party goes to fetch the biologist
- They eventually get back, the biologist is very excited
- These creatures were very prolific companions for powerful mages back in the day
	- The biologist doesn't know why he'd want one
	- He's pretty secretive about the magic he does
	- It was definitely in a fight with the t-rex
	- The biologist does know of something that'll help us get into his house
		- He keeps a secret backup key in a vault north of [[cities/Strig|Strig]]
- We leave the creature with the biologist

## Heading back to [[cities/Strig|Strig]]
- We stay the night in the little town and then head to [[cities/North|North]]
- I completely fucking zoned out by accident idk i cant take notes
