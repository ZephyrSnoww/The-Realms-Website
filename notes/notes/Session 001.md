# Session 1

## Research lab grand opening
- Grand opening of a big research lab at [[places/Dragonfir University|Dragonfir University]]
- [[people/pcs/Holly|Holly]], [[people/pcs/Kirin Vance|Kirin]], and [[people/pcs/Marie Santello|Marie]] met on the boatride over
- [[people/pcs/Glass|Glass]] and [[people/pcs/Alixxon|Alixxon]] knew each other previously
	- Alixxon is a huge nerd, so
	- They like Glass
- Lots of pretentious folk at the opening
- Anthro peacock comes onto the stage - he's the [[people/npcs/Crisius Fowl|superintendent]]
	- Very fancy cloak
	- Crisius Fowl is his name
	- Being the principal is game
	- Onstage with him is a few bodyguards
	- He has a very smooth, nice voice
	- It's just good
- The facility has been delayed a bunch
- Kirin and Glass intimidate Kish (who was stealing) into giving the coins back

## Fighting a t-rex
- A very loud roar happens, from right behind the new building
	- Reptilian, dinosaur type deal
	- Dinosaurs aren't very common here but they exist
- Kirin runs towards the beast
- We all fight it, Kirin and Glass beat it the hell up
- Marie takes a scale

## Following the t-rex's trail
- We decide to try to find where the dinosaur came from
	- Holly brings up that "why" is more important than "where"
	- But "where" could lead to "why"
	- The dinosaur has bitemarks on it
		- These might be important or something
		- They're smaller than the t-rex's
		- There are large canines and serrated, shark-like teeth in the back
- We travel away from the town, eventually arriving at another town in late afternoon
	- The dinosaur basically went straight through the town
	- "It was like it was running from something"
	- There's a biology professor of the university that lives here

## Meeting Professor Lee
- We head out of town, walking to the professors house
	- Its a pretty hodge-podge house, all over the place design-wise
	- We talk with them and they were barely aware that the dinosaur thing happened
	- It's professor Lee
		- Mismatch of animal parts, just about as hodge-podge as the house
			- yeah
	- The interior is just as all over the place
- We give the professor the scale that Marie took
- The professor offers us tea so we all head upstairs
	- There are bloodstains and a bonesaw upstairs
	- We tell the professor about the bite marks
		- She opens a book that hasn't been opened in a long time (dusty etc. etc.)
		- There's a big dog with wings or something I kindof zoned out
			- The creature is said to be extinct
			- But the teeth marks match
			- It's scientific name is Canna Tetrathoptera
				- It's sunlight sensitive
					- Lives in caves
					- Comes out at night
	- We also ask him about Crisius Fowl
		- She doesn't particularly like him but he's her boss, so
		- He doesn't like the government, thinks the school should have more power

## Retconned travel
- ~~Then we continue following the trail~~
- ~~Not very far from the village, we come across a big cave~~
	- ~~It's pretty big, big enough for a t-rex~~
	- ~~Has some scratch marks at the opening~~
	- ~~yup~~
