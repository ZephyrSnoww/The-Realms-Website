# Session 4

## stuff
- We decide to go to the government that the superintendant is fighting against
- From what we can see on the schematics, theres a hidden basement like several hundred meters below the surface
	- It has a bigass elevator room
	- Then a big cavernous half room half cave that branches a bunch
		- It looks like theres some ancient artifact underground
- We ride back to professor Lee's house, and give her the evidence
	- There's a funny interaction
- We all head back to the building to sneak into the basement
- We plan to head into a back entrance
	- Holly heads in a window as a rat and then opens the window for everyone else
- We make our way to the closet with the hidden entrance and hit the switch
- We get into the shady elevator and head down
	- It goes 2 km into the ground
	- There's water dripping somewhere, very echo-y
	- Theres writing
		- Cog deciphers it, its a map of the realms like redrawn into a summoning circle
		- It looks like draconic writing, but none of us understand it
		- In the center of the circle theres two images
			- One that looks like a geometric, angular map of the world
				- Has all the measurements and stuff, all very planned and neat
			- Looks like its mushed with another map
	- They found the circle, it wasnt built
	-
