# Holly

---

Holly is an orange, fluffy kobold, born on [date]. She grew up in [[Place]], until running away/being cast out at the age of 18. Since then, she has lived in the [[countries/Kaldenvar|Kalvarian]] wilderness, learning about the local flora and fauna, as well as learning wild magic.

## Early Life

Holly was born in [[Place]], on [date]. Her mother, Jill, was a red kobold, and her father, Kyrin, was a brown kobold. Her parents ran a small, locally well-known bakery, which she helped run growing up. Her mother died on [date], when a band of marauders ran through the town, stealing supplies. Jill tried to defend the bakery, and was killed in the process. Holly and her father were left to rebuild, and worked hard to return the bakery to its former state, in honor of Jill.

Holly started a secretive relationship with the local princess, [[Faith Glymja]]. The two met while hunting, and agreed to hunt together every couple days. Over time, the two fell in love.

On [date], Holly was caught sneaking into the local castle. She had snuck in before, but was only caught this time because guard shifts had changed. The castle was on high alert for internal spies after hearing rumors, and Holly was banished from the town. Faith's pleadings were ignored, as everyone thought she had been tricked by the supposed spy.

## Current Life

Since then, Holly has lived in the wilderness. She sends letters of corerspondence back to her father, to keep in touch. For the first few weeks after she was kicked out, she kept going back to where her and Faith would meet to hunt, but Faith had been kept in the castle under the presumption that she was unsafe. Holly eventually gave up and began travelling, using her hunting skills to survive the Kalvarian wilderness.
